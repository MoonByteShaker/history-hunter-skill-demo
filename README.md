# history-hunter skill-demo
This project is intended as a small demo to convince the reader of my developer skills.

The files contained in the project are intended to provide an overview of the style guide and general programming techniques.

Things that I think I want to give a special note will be commented on with a commit. In this way it is easier for the reader to find the places that I want to point out.

Each commit will be referenced to an issue. This makes it easier to add another comment afterwards or to answer existing questions.

Have fun browsing :-)
