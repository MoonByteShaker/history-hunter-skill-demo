# history-hunter skill-demo
This project is intended as a small demo to convince the reader of my ability to develop good scalable software.

The files contained in the project are aiming to provide an overview of my style guide and general programming techniques.

Things, that I think I want to give a special note, will be commented on with a commit. In this way it is easier for the reader to find the places that I want to point out.

Each commit will be referenced to an issue. This makes it easier to add another comment afterwards or to answer existing questions.

Have fun browsing :-)
